        <p><i>Sherlock Holmes</i> is a fictional private detective created by British author <i>Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.</i> Known as a "consulting detective" in the stories, Holmes is known for a proficiency with observation, forensic science, and logical reasoning that borders on the fantastic, which he employs when investigating cases for a wide variety of clients, including <i>Scotland Yard.</i> Amongst other foibles, Holmes had a penchant for papier mâché.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="fade">
        <p>First appearing in print in 1887 (in <i>A Study in Scarlet</i>), the character's popularity became widespread with the first series of short stories in <i>The Strand Magazine,</i> beginning with <i>"A Scandal in Bohemia"</i> in 1891; additional tales appeared from then to 1927, eventually totalling four novels and 56 short stories.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="fade">
        <p>All but one are set in the Victorian or Edwardian periods, taking place between about 1880 to 1914. Most are narrated by the character of Holmes's friend and biographer <i>Dr. Watson,</i> who usually accompanies Holmes during his investigations and often shares quarters with him at the address of <i>221B Baker Street, London,</i> where many of the stories begin.</p>

        <p><i>Dr John H. Watson</i> is a medical doctor, formerly in the British Army. He was married to <i>Mary Watson</i> and is arguably the only friend and confidant of <i>Sherlock Holmes.</i></p>
    </div>
    <div class="fade">
        <p>In the debut Holmes story <i>A Study in Scarlet,</i> Watson, as the narrator, describes meeting Holmes, their subsequent sharing of rooms at <i>221B Baker Street,</i> his attempts to discover the profession of his taciturn companion, Holmes's eventual taking of Watson into his confidence, and the events surrounding their first case together. Watson describes Holmes and his methods in too romantic and sentimental a manner for Holmes' taste.</p>
    </div>
        <div class="fade">
            <p>In time, they become close friends. In <i>The Sign of Four,</i> <i>John Watson</i> met <i>Mary Morstan,</i> who became his wife. Mary seemed somewhat less sure of her husband, however, absentmindedly calling him "James" in the short story <i>"The Man with the Twisted Lip".</i> This may be a simple typographical error, though some have speculated that it is a wifely reference to Watson's unknown middle name, which could have been "Hamish" (Scottish for "James") <i>Dorothy Sayers,</i> creator of the detective <i>Lord Peter Wimsey,</i> also wrote several essays on Holmesian speculation, later published this theory in <i>Unpopular Opinions.</i></p>
